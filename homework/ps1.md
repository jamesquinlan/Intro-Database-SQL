### Problem Set 1 - Introduction to DQL 
---

Data Query Language (DQL) is a sub-language of Structured Query Language (SQL).  The SELECT statement is the one (and only) statement needed to construct database queries.  A query extracts data from the database.  A SELECT statement **must** contain a FROM clause.  The basic syntax for SELECT statement is:

`
SELECT column(s)
FROM table
`

Often (although not necessary) each statement/clause is written at the beginning of a line.  In particular, 

` SELECT column(s) 
FROM table
`

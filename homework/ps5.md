Create a datamodel (database) for the math department. We need a database that can be used to track and advise students as well as aid in scheduling future classes. The database should include students (include e.g., PIN, graduation year), whether they are major/minor, list of faculty advisors from the math department, and which classes the students have had and in which semester. 
What do you recommend for a front-end interface to the database? Are there any other details of which you can think?

#### SELECT statement

The `SELECT` statement is the one (and only) statement needed to construct database queries.  A query extracts data from the database.  A `SELECT` statement **must** contain a `FROM` clause.  The basic syntax for `SELECT` statement is:

```SQL
SELECT column(s) FROM table(s)
```

Often (although not necessary) each statement/clause is written at the beginning of a line.  In particular, 

```SQL
SELECT column(s) 
FROM table(s)
```

NOTE: If database is housed on a shared server, the database name must proceed the table name separated with the dot notation.  In particular, 

```SQL
SELECT column(s) 
FROM database.table
```

If multiple columns are desired in the query results, a comma delimited list of column names is supplied after the `SELECT` statement. Similar a list of one or more tables follows the FROM clause.   The query below SELECTs `column1`, `column2`, and `column3`. 


```SQL
SELECT column1, column2, column3 FROM database.table;
```



The * is a wildcard and returns **all** columns from the table.  

For example, the following query will return the entire table (use with caution).

```SQL
SELECT * FROM database.table;
```


#### The WHERE clause

The `WHERE` clause is a conditional that limits the number of records returned to ones that match a specified *condition*.  The value of the condition is TRUE or FALSE.  The `WHERE` clause limits or **filters** the number of records returned by the query. The general syntax is:

```SQL
SELECT column(s)
FROM database.table
WHERE [condition]
```
For example, selecting all records from the products table where country is China, 

```SQL
SELECT *
FROM Products
WHERE country='China';
```


Multiple/complex conditions can be specified using `AND` or `OR`.  In particular,

```SQL
SELECT column(s)
FROM database.table
WHERE [condition1] AND/OR [condition2]
```


#### The ORDER BY clause

Another clause that can be added to a `SELECT` statment is the `ORDER BY` clause.  Like the name implies, it will order the records in ascending or descending order.  Ascending is default.  It can be used with or without the `WHERE` clause.  

```SQL
SELECT column1, column2
FROM database.table
ORDER BY column2;
```

### Data and Relational Modeling
----

##### Definitions (alphebetical):

1. __Attributes__: columns of a table 
1. __Data model__: is a description of data (information/situation/etc.) that includes the structure (attributes), the operations (queries/modifications), and constraints (field types)
1. __Domain__: Each component of the tuple is atomic data type (integer, string)
1. __Relation__: is a table; a set of tuples, not ordered list (see tuple below).  Relations change over time (tables get updated)
1. __Relational Model__: describes data using relations (i.e., tables)
1. __Schemas__: Name and attributes of a relation.  For example, `Course(title, room, time, instructor)`
1. __Tuples__: rows of a relation.  Tuples have one component for each attribute.
